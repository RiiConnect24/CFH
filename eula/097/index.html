<p class="cjk">Your
Wii Console and the Wii Network Service are not designed for use with
unauthorized software, services, or devices or non-licensed
accessories, and you may not use any of these with your Wii Console
or the Wii Network Service. Such use may be illegal, voids any
warranty, and is a breach of this agreement. Such use may also lead
to injury to you or others or cause performance issues or damage to
your Wii Console or the Wii Network Service. We (and our licensees
and distributors) are not responsible for damage or loss caused by
unauthorized software, services or devices or non-licensed
accessories. We may take steps to disable or delete any unauthorized
software, services or device installed in your Wii Console, for
example, by detecting and disabling them through the Wii Network

services, or devices, your access to the Wii Network Service may be
disabled and/or the Wii Console or games may be unplayable.</p>

upgrade, change, or terminate the Content or game software or may
discontinue offering Products without notice to you.</p>

<p class="cjk">Article
2: <u>Downloads and Purchases</u></p>
<p class="cjk">
The Wii Shop
allows you to download a license to use Content or purchase Products.
 Such downloads and purchases may be accomplished by using Points or
other means, such as using codes purchased from Nintendo or a third
party which can be redeemed by you to download Content or purchase
products from the Wii Shop.  The Wii Shop may also allow you to do
such things as download licenses to use certain Content for free, or
use your Points to send Content to a friend. All such downloads,
purchases, and other uses of the Wii Shop are subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this agreement.</p>
<p class="cjk">
Points are
primarily intended for the purchase of downloadable video game
content, and are taxed accordingly. Points are not your personal
property. <b>Points have no cash or monetary value and are
non-refundable.</b></p>
<p class="cjk">
Once
you place Points into your Wii Shop Account, you <b>may
not withdraw, sell, or transfe</b><b>r</b> them to another.
You are responsible for your or anyone else’s use of Points in
your Wii Shop Account, even if you did not give them permission to
use those Points.</p>
<p class="cjk">
If we suspect
fraudulent or unlawful activity concerning your Wii Shop Account or
your use of Points, we may cancel, suspend, or otherwise limit your
access to all or part of the Wii Network Service. If, as a result,
your Wii Shop Account or your Points are deleted, they will be
reinstated at our sole discretion.</p>
<p class="cjk">Article
3: <u>Credit-Card Charges and Your Billing Account</u></p>

purchase Points are nonrefundable.</p>

each transaction will be available for at least one year through the
Wii Shop.</p>

We may use
third parties to provide any portion of the Wii Network Service. We

to purchase from us a license to use such Content or to get Product.
We may also allow third parties to directly provide Third-Party Data
to you through the Wii Network Service.</p>
<p class="cjk">Article
2: <u>Intellectual Property</u></p>

We own all
right, title and interest in, or have the right to distribute, use or

MEANS WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE Wii NETWORK SERVICE, CONTENT OR
PRODUCTS WILL BE FREE FROM VIRUSES, HACKS, OR OTHER POTENTIALLY
HARMFUL INTRUSIONS. PLEASE NOTE THAT SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW SUCH
WARRANTY LIMITATIONS, SO THESE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
PLEASE SEE THE Wii OPERATIONS MANUAL FOR ANY WARRANTIES THAT APPLY TO
THE Wii CONSOLE.</b></p>
<p class="cjk">Article
9: <u>Limitation on Claims</u></p>
<p class="cjk">
If you think
you have a claim against us related to the Wii Console or the Wii
Network Service, you must take legal action within one year after the
date of the alleged incident. After the one-year period expires, you
may never raise that claim.</p>
<p class="cjk">Article
10: <u>Change, Suspension or Discontinuance of Wii Network Service</u></p>
<p class="cjk">
We may change,
suspend, or discontinue the Wii Network Service, or any feature or
aspect of the Wii Network Service, at any time, with or without
notice to you, and without liability to us. This includes, but is not
limited to, the availability of all or any portion of the Wii Network
Service, Content, Products, Points, and the number of Points required
to redeem particular Content or Products.</p>
<p class="cjk">Article
11: <u>Limited Responsibilities and Indemnification</u></p>
<p class="cjk">
You agree to
waive any and all rights to claim damages or losses caused to you or
relating to your inability to use the Wii Network Service (or to
anyone else using the Wii Network Service through your Wii Console).
You understand you might never be fully compensated for that damage
or loss if we or one of our licensees, licensors or suppliers
(collectively referred to in this Article 11 as “we” or
“us”) somehow harm you. This is because we limit our
liability to you (and to others) in several ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="cjk">Your
	ability to recover damages or losses from us is limited: you may
	recover only direct damages, up to the total amount you have ever
	paid for Points. Generally, direct damages are losses you (or anyone
	else) suffer as the immediate result of something someone has done
	wrong.</p>
	</li><li><p class="cjk">You
	may not recover any other types of damages, no matter the reason.
	For example, sometimes a court will award a special amount of
	damages to punish the person at fault, or, a person might have to
	pay for damages where the person did not directly cause harm. You
	agree that we will never have to pay punitive, special,
	consequential, or incidental damages to you.</p>
	</li><li><p class="cjk">We
	are also not liable to anyone else, or for the actions or inactions
	of anyone else. For example, if your friend is somehow harmed using
	the Wii Network Service or the Wii Console, we are not responsible
	to you, your friend, or anyone else. If another person somehow harms
	you while using your Wii Console or Wii Network Service, we are not
	liable to you for that other person’s actions.</p>
</li></ul>
<p class="cjk">
These
limitations on liability apply to all matters relating to the Wii
Network Service and the Wii Console, including your use of the Wii
Network Service and your use of Content or Products that do not
specify other limitations on liability. These limitations also apply
to any legal or equitable theory, including but not limited to breach
of contract, breach of warranty, strict liability, negligence, or
other tort. Please note, however, that some states or provinces do
not permit certain limitations like these, so these limits on other
damages may not fully apply to you.</p>
<p class="cjk">
If you breach
this agreement, and we or another company or person is harmed by your
breach, then you must indemnify us (and our licensees, licensors, and
suppliers and any of our employees) from all of the losses and costs
related to your breach, including our attorneys’ fees. You must
also indemnify us for any claims relating to Third-Party Data
modified, created, or sent by you.</p>
<p class="cjk">Article
12: <u>Expiration and Termination of Agreement</u></p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="cjk">You
	may cancel your Wii Shop Account by contacting our customer-service
	department or by following the instructions in the Wii Shop. If your
	Wii Shop Account is canceled or terminated for any reason, you will
	no longer be able to use the Wii Shop. You will lose all downloaded
	Content and forfeit any rights to any unused Points, which become
	our property.</p>
	</li><li><p class="cjk">You
	may terminate this agreement by removing Content from your Wii
	Console, discontinuing use of the Wii Network Service, and
	forfeiting any rights to Points in your Wii Shop Account, which
	become our property.</p>
	</li><li><p class="cjk">We
	may terminate this agreement, or any portion thereof, at any time,
	for any reason whatsoever. Such termination will void any licenses
	granted in accordance with this agreement and may prevent your use
	of the Wii Network Service.</p>
	</li><li><p class="cjk">We
	have no obligation to return or refund Points to you, even if the
	agreement ends.</p>
	</li><li><p class="cjk">In
	the event this agreement is terminated or canceled, the following
	sections will remain in effect: Unauthorized Software, Services, or
	Devices or Unlicensed Accessories; Credit-Card Charges and Your
	Billing Account; Intellectual Property; Hosting, Intercepting,
	Emulating, and Reverse-Engineering Prohibited; Submissions;
	Warranties; Limitation on Claims; Limited Responsibilities and
	Indemnification; Expiration and Termination of Agreement; Governing
	Law, Legal Jurisdiction, and Interpretation of Agreement.</p>

Privacy Policy only applies to information submitted or collected
through the Wii Network Service. Information you may submit through
any of Nintendo's web sites is subject to the privacy policy posted
on those sites.</p>
<p class="cjk">Please

Service by you and any other person using your Wii Console.

<p class="cjk"><b>ATTENTION
PARENTS OR LEGAL GUARDIANS: PROTECTING CHILDREN'S PRIVACY </b>
</p>
<p class="cjk">Before
allowing your children to use the Wii Network Service, we strongly
recommend you educate them on the importance of not sharing personal
information about themselves with strangers. In particular, we
recommend you tell your children not to use personal information for
any nicknames on games, user names, names for Miis or any other
applications that use the Wii Network Service. You should also keep
in mind that certain Wii games use the Wii Network Service to create
the opportunity for users to communicate in-game.</p>
<p class="cjk">We
strongly recommend you assist your children with the setup of the Wii
Network Service, and that you supervise your children's use of the
Wii Network Service at all times. You can restrict use of certain
aspects of the Wii Network Services by setting up the Wii Console’s
parental controls function. You may also disconnect your Wii Console
from the Wii Network Service, as explained in your Wii Operations
Manual. 
</p>
<p class="cjk"><b>INFORMATION
COLLECTED </b>
</p>
<p class="cjk">Personal
Information is information that may be directly linked to you such as
your name, address, telephone number, or name based e-mail address
(for example, MyWii@Nintendo.com). We may ask you to provide us with
certain Personal Information when you register your Wii Console on
the Wii Network Service, download games or contact us with questions
or comments. In addition to the Personal Information you provide to
us, we may anonymously collect information from you such as your age,
gender, geographic area, Wii Console identifier and Wii message
address, without linking your Personal Information to this anonymous
information.   We will not link your Personal Information with any
anonymous information we collect from you unless (1) you authorize us
to do so; (2) you choose to link your Wii Shop Account to your Club
Nintendo account; or (3) we notify you first.  In order to provide
you with more customized services, we may also receive and record
information on our server logs from the Wii Network Service,
including but not limited to your internet protocol (IP) address,
cookies, transactions, settings and download activity.  If you
provide sensitive information when communicating with third parties
via the Wii Network Service, Nintendo does not receive or collect
that information. Your Wii Console may store that sensitive
information for your convenience.</p>
<p class="cjk"><b>HOW
SUCH INFORMATION IS USED </b>
</p>
<p class="cjk">We
may request either personal or anonymous information from you for
several purposes including to: (i) complete your Wii Network Service
registration; (ii) customize your Wii Shop catalog and other
catalogs; (iii) communicate with you regarding games, contests,
sweepstakes, surveys, product changes, system issues and more; (iv)
allow you to participate in the Wii messaging service, message boards
and other Wii online services; (v) process orders you have placed
through the Wii channels; and (vi) set up repair orders. Some of the
types of information collected and the way the information is handled
are detailed by category below.</p>
<p class="cjk"><b>Surveys</b>:
We may conduct surveys of Wii Console users. The information we
collect from you in a survey will be demographic or opinion
information and will not be tied to your Personal Information unless
we notify you otherwise. The results of aggregate data collected from
surveys, but not Personal Information, may be disclosed to the
public. 
</p>
<p class="cjk"><b>Contests
and Sweepstakes</b>: We may host various contests and sweepstakes. To
enter you may be required to submit certain Personal Information
about yourself. For more information about Nintendo contests or
sweepstakes, please see the official rules of the contest or
sweepstakes you are entering.</p>
<p class="cjk"><b>Nintendo
Channel:</b>  You may choose to share certain anonymous information
with us through the Nintendo Channel, which we may use to make
certain recommendations to you or to develop new games and services.
The Nintendo Channel does not collect Personal Information.  Your use
of the Nintendo Channel is anonymous and will remain so unless you
choose to link your Wii Shop Account to your Club Nintendo account.
For more information, please select the “How Your Information
Is Used” menu in the Settings section of the Nintendo Channel
or visit http://support.nintendo.com.</p>
<p class="cjk"><b>Wii
Shop Account</b>: If you pay for items through the Wii Shop with your
credit card, you need to provide a valid credit card number,
expiration date, credit card security code and your city,
state/county/province and zip code/postal code. We do not ask for
your name or your complete address unless you order items that we
must ship to you, rather than deliver via a download. You must be
over the age of 18 to enter into the Wii Network Service User
Agreement, and to place orders online. Any credit card information
you submit through the Wii Shop will be transmitted in an encrypted
manner. All such encrypted information will be maintained and
processed by Nintendo and its trusted third party credit card
processor on secure computers that are not accessible from the
Internet. This encrypted information is subject to the section below
entitled “Security.”</p>
<p class="cjk"><b>Wii
Message Service</b>: When you connect to the Wii Network Service, we
provide you an automatically generated Wii message address. Your Wii
message address is anonymous and will remain so unless you choose to
(a) share it with other people in order to send Wii messages; (b)
share it with other people in order for them to add your Wii Console
to their in-game friend list; or (c) link your Wii Shop Account to
your Club Nintendo account. You have the ability to choose through
our parental controls function whether to allow use of the Wii
message service on your Wii Console. If you choose not to use the Wii
message service, you will not receive emails from third parties. You
also can choose not to receive certain messages from Nintendo by
selecting the “opt-out” option on Wii channels or by
using the opt-out option included in commercial messages sent by
Nintendo to your Wii message address. However, you may still receive
messages on your Wii Message Board that originate from members of
your household as well as messages from us related to transactions or
services you have specifically requested; in response to any email
from you to us; to notify you of updates or changes to our policies
and procedures; or to otherwise provide you with information
important to all Wii users.</p>
<p class="cjk"><b>IP
Addresses</b>: Your Wii Console is automatically assigned an IP
address by your Internet Service Provider when you connect to the Wii
Network Service. The Wii Network Service automatically creates log
files of user activities on the Wii Network and may also record the
IP address of users. In general, we only use log files to monitor
traffic on our Web sites and to troubleshoot technical problems. In
the event you do not comply with our Wii Code of Conduct when using
the Wii Network Service, however, we may block your IP address. We do
not link IP addresses to Personal Information unless we notify you or
unless necessary to enforce our Wii Code of Conduct or respond to
legal process.</p>
<p class="cjk"><b>Web
Beacons</b>: The Wii Network Service uses common Internet technology
called "Web beacons" (also called "Web bugs,"
"action tags," "pixel trackers," or "clear
GIFs"), which are small graphic images placed on a Web page,
Web-based document, or in an e-mail message, designed to collect
certain information and monitor user activity online. Web beacons are
invisible to you because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1
pixel) and the same color as the background of the Web page, document
or e-mail message. We may use Web beacons to collect non-personal
information such as the Wii Console IP address, the URL of the page
the Web user comes from, and the time the Web beacon is activated
(such as when you view the Web page, advertisement, or e-mail
containing the Web beacon). We do not use Web beacons to collect
Personal Information.</p>
<p class="cjk"><b>Cookies</b>:
The Wii Network Service may use cookies, which are small text files
that a Web site places on your Wii Console. These files identify your
Wii Console and record data about your visit so that when you return
to the site, the site recognizes your Wii Console and can personalize
your visit. Cookies may be linked to your transaction history, game
play or other information gathered through the Wii Network Service.
We may use information collected by cookies, as well as other tools
such as log files or Web beacons, for determining how to improve the
Wii Network Service by seeing which areas, features, and products are
most popular; personalizing the services and making recommendations
based on downloaded products; and completing transactions you have
requested. In the event you visit a third party’s website
through the Internet browser option offered on the Wii Network
Service, or we employ a third party advertising company to display
ads on the Wii Network Service, those websites or ads may also
contain cookies. Any information gathered through such cookies is
collected by the third party, not by us, and we have no access to or
control over these cookies or the information contained within them.</p>
<p class="cjk"><b>Other:
</b>In order to constantly improve the products and services we
provide and better meet your needs, we may also use your Personal
Information as well as anonymous information for our internal
marketing, demographic studies, and quality assurance. In some cases,
we may add to or update your Personal Information with data collected
from other sources (e.g., mail-in registration cards or date of
purchase information from retailers). If we combine information
collected offline with information collected through the Wii Network
Service, the combined information will be treated in accordance with
this Wii Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="cjk"><b>DISCLOSURE
OF INFORMATION </b>
</p>
<p class="cjk">We
do not sell or rent any of our customers’ Personal Information
to third parties. We may, however, share personal or anonymous
information with our vendors to help us perform various functions
necessary to operate our business (for example, completing downloads
or purchases made through the Wii Shop, developing and executing
marketing campaigns, etc.) and with our affiliated companies. We may
disclose Personal Information in order to comply with legal process,
respond to claims or inquiries, or protect the rights, property or
personal safety of Nintendo, our customers or the public. In
addition, information about our customers, including Personal
Information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, sale, transfer
of company assets, or acquisition, if permitted by and done in
accordance with applicable laws.

<p class="cjk">You
may link your Wii Shop Account to your Club Nintendo account in order
to receive personalized content and participate in a variety of

<p class="cjk">Certain
Wii games and Wii channels give you the opportunity to nickname your
Miis, create a user id and interact with other Wii users. We strongly
encourage you not to use your own name for any Miis or any user ids
you may create. In addition, we strongly encourage you not to share
Personal Information about yourself and not to allow your children to
share Personal Information about themselves with other Wii users.</p>
<p class="cjk">For
certain Wii Content, including some Wii games and Wii channels, your
Wii Friends may have access to information such as whether you have

</p>
<p class="cjk">Certain
sensitive or Personal Information about you may be stored on your Wii

transferring your Wii Console, please be sure to clean and securely
remove all Personal Information, Wii messages, any pictures or

Console and clearing your Wii Shop Account activity, please review
the Wii Operations Manual: Channels and Settings.</p>
<p class="cjk">Your
Wii Console may allow certain sensitive or Personal Information to be
stored on the Wii Remote as well.  Accordingly, by using your Wii
Remote on a Wii Console other than your own, it is possible that
certain sensitive or Personal Information about you could be shared
with the other Wii Console.</p>
<p class="cjk"><b>UPDATES
AND UPGRADES </b>
</p>
<p class="cjk">We
may without notifying you, download updates, patches, upgrades and
similar software to your Wii Console and may disable unauthorized or
illegal software placed on your Wii Console to ensure that your Wii
Console is operating properly and efficiently, comply with applicable
laws, assist law enforcement, protect us and our customers, or
prevent the use and distribution of software obtained through
improper channels.</p>
<p class="cjk"><b>SECURITY
</b>
</p>
<p class="cjk">We
have established reasonable safeguards to secure Personal Information
collected directly by us in an effort to ensure the security,
integrity and privacy of the Personal Information collected and
transferred through your Wii Network Service. We also have
implemented reasonable security measures in an effort to protect
information under our control against loss, misuse or alteration.
While
we strive to safeguard your Personal Information, no data storage
system or transmission of data over the Internet or any other public
network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
<p class="cjk">Please
